# Module-1-Challenge
Week 1 challenge with HTML and CSS for Hiseon Webpage

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

I went through the code starter, and where possible, replaced the <div> tags with proper tags such as <section> or <article> or <aside> 

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

In addition to the above changes mentioned, I went through the CSS and eliminated repetitive code where necessary. I changed class descriptions to merge them into one class to apply stylings where possible. I tried on subsequent sections and could not get it to work without messing up the webpage, so in those instances I eliminated repetitive code by using commas to separate the classes, and then applied to same code to each class that way.
